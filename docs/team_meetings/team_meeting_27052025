computing nodes on docker, 4 simple primitives
then combine them to complexer operations
cpp dpesnt allow the extension
you need to extend the code
translate it to rust
people add the sql queries
were not doing software
how you split one bit into 3 parties - the code that sent long
real impl. in cpp in secrecy

only those 8 sql
the framework shuold be extendable to every sql query

1. impl the arithm and boolean primitives
2. complex operations (eq, ineq)
3. SQL operators

the informtion is a like a vector or a bitstring

the 2 interfaces (todos)
1. impl. secret sharing for data owners, doesnt have to do anything with computing nodes. Garbage values ?
2. Developer comes at 1 and he can execute the query on secretly shared

additional rq: impl. triple computation.
xor and and are exchanged, and then adding the 3rd research question
add one rq to 9cp, what's the merit of that

3. contribution: distiction to existing approaches, emphasize the diffs. not describe the existing apps. major limitations. 
extensibility
multipliocation triples to reduce the sync costs

frontend to data owners? usability increase? maybe in the end
like a dashboard. it is needed to be integrated ?

4. evaluation? for 6 and 9 cp. me and denis

room for friday in stami
