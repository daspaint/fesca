First follow all the instructions listed here:
https://md.darmstadt.ccc.de/s/fcKBwUSrp#First-steps-to-set-up-your-Data-Management-account
The config file for VPN is here: docs\DM Main.ovpn. This is important that all keys are in OpenSSH format.

We can use the ZS server for our computing tasks. The nodes that are available to us are from zs01 to zs09. The following tutorial will be done using zs01.
The URL for server is http://zs01.lab.dm.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/

You can check your VPN connection by typing 

    ipconfig

in Powershell or executing

    ping zs01.lab.dm.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de

1. After establishing VPN connection, it's time to connect to compute servers using SSH. For this place your
    private key file in .ssh folder in the root folder of your PC (e.g. C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.ssh\yourname_id_rsa on Windows). Set the permissions of the private key file only to you and remove anything else.
2. Open your command prompt and enter
    ssh yourname@zs01.lab.dm.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de -i "C:\Users\<YourWindowsUsername>\.ssh\yourname_id_rsa"

    Alternatively you can create a config file inside of .ssh folder with those contents:

    Host zs01
        HostName zs01.lab.dm.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de
        User yourname
        IdentityFile C:\Users\<YourWindowsUsername>\.ssh\yourname_id_rsa

    If you didn't mess up with the keys you should see the following message:
